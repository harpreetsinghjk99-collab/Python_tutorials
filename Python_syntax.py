#Python use indentation to indicate a block of code
#indentation refer to the space in the begining of the code line. 
if 2 > 3: 
    print ("2 is greater than 3")
else:
    print("3 is greater than 2")

#Python will give error if the you skip the indentation
#Can use same no of spaces otherwise pyhton will thrown an error
#It is recomended to use tab insread (equivalent to 4 spaces)
